In this project, i have analysed the Hotel Booking dataset(downloaded from kaggle), using python libraries pandas, matplotlib and seaborn to find the answers of the following questions based on the dataset:
(1). What are the variables that affect hotel reservation cancellations?
(2).How can we make hotel reservations cancellations better?
(3).How will hotels be assisted in making pricing and promotional decisions?
